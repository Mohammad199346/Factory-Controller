## Project Overview

The Roblox TransporterSync project aims to synchronize transporter movement in a Roblox environment through a backend API. This allows real-time coordination and control of transporters within the game world.

## Features

- Seamless synchronization between Roblox environment and backend server.
- Creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion of transporter positions.
- Collision detection to prevent transporters from passing through obstacles.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Setup Roblox Environment:**
- Open the Roblox Studio and load your game environment.
- Ensure transporters are set up with proper properties for collision.

3. **Configure Backend:**
- Install required dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the backend server: `npm start`
- The server will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

1. **Roblox Environment:**
- Transporters in the Roblox environment will interact with the backend API automatically.
- Transporters should be set to move with respect to collision detection.

2. **Backend API:**
- The backend provides routes to create, update, retrieve, and delete transporter positions.
- Refer to the [API documentation](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed usage.
